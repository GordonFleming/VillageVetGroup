    <h3>Delivery Policy and Charges</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>In line with remaining connected to our customers, as we will miss seeing you and your pets in store, we would like to personalise our on-line ordering and delivery service to you.</li>
        <li>With this in mind we will endeavour to fill your order efficiently and correctly, and to deliver to you as soon as possible once your order is placed and confirmed.</li>
        <li>Once you have placed your order, it will immediately be sent to us for verification. Here, you will be able to ask any questions or get professional advice on anything you need to know about your order or your chosen products. We will also then confirm stock availability and confirm any colour or pattern choices, where applicable. </li>
        <li>Once you have heard back from us you may proceed to the payment page and as soon as your order is confirmed, we will contact you telephonically or via email to check someone will be home to accept the delivery and then deliver as soon as possible, either the same day or next day.</li>
        <li>If for some reason we do not have any of your order in stock we will let you know immediately and advise when we will deliver, once we receive stock from our suppliers. Sometimes we will not be able to always provide you with the colour or pattern of your choice, as these are dependent on stock availability, but we will stay in touch with you to offer alternatives</li>

However, if you fall slightly outside our delivery area, please just enquire on the order request page and we will let you know if we are able to deliver to you. We charge R55 for all deliveries no matter the size or bowl amount.</strong></li>
        <li>We aim to deliver your stock personally, so as to ensure you received the correct stock and all in good order.</li>
        <li>Deliveries will take place Monday – Friday between 09h00 and 18h30</li>
        <li>Please place a detailed daytime delivery address, as well as contact number and email address on the order request page.</li>
