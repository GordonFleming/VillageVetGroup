    <h3>The Returns Process</h3>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <h4><li>Contact Us</li></h4>
            <p>If on receiving your order you are not absolutely happy with your purchase or we have delivered the wrong product or a faulty product, please <a href="mailto:villagevetshop@yebo.co.za">email</a> or call us on <a href="tel:0118830004">011 883 0004</a> immediately.</p>
        <h4><li>Return the Item(s)</li></h4>
            <p>We pride ourselves on our attention to detail but sometimes we get things wrong. If we have delivered an incorrect, faulty or expired item to you, we will arrange to collect and replace or refund the item, at our cost, as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p>If you are wanting to return an item because it is unpalatable to your pet, doesn't fit your pet or you have changed your mind and don't want it any more, you will need to arrange to return the item, at your own cost, to our address listed below in the footer.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to charge a 10% administration fee for returned orders should the returns process incur significant administration expenses.</p>
        <h4><li>Receive a Replacement or Refund</li></h4>
            <p>If the return is due to an error on our part we will replace the item or process a refund (where available*) as quickly as possible after receiving the returned product. A refund will typically take a maximum of 10 working days from the date of receiving your returned item, and we will notify you by email when the refund has been processed. Unfortunately we can't send you a proof of payment as this is typically handled by a third party payment processing partner.</p>
        <h4><li>Repairing an Item</li></h4>
            <p>If your product is out of its warranty period, you will incur shipping and repair costs. There will be a minimum fee of R100 to collect and return it to you. The amount you pay will be based on your collection and delivery location. If the product is still under warranty, the collection and return costs will be on us.</p>
            <p>Any repairs not covered by warranty will be quoted on for your approval, and we will require payment before any work is done.</p>
